<td align="left"><p>Greetings! I received my PhD degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia. My supervisors are A/Professor Lina Yao and Professor Salil Kanhere. Before joining UNSW, I have worked as a research assistant with School of Computer Science and Technology at Shandong University. I received the B.S. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2008. My research interests include artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision. I have published about 20 technical papers at prominent journals and conferences such as IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE), IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS), IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics (TCYB), IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (T-IP), IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics (TII), Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU), CVPR, AAAI, Australasian Database Conference (ADC), etc.
